# Deprecation Notice
This repository has been deprecated. wpijavacv died for a reason. It's terrible. Please see [RooSight](https://github.com/Roobotics-FRC/RooSight)- our own (WIP) vision processing library that actually works.

# wpijavacv-fork
This repository is our own fork of wpijavacv updated to work with newer opencv and javacv libraries. It includes Jared Russel's DaisyCV code from [this](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/papers/2676) release. Use it as you will, but know that it is still a work in progress.
